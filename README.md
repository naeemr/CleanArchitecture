# Tariff Comparison

This project is developed to implement a clean architecture.

## Installation 

Developed this in.Net 6 with Visual Studio 2022.
	
Implemented Onion Architecture to design the clean & logical layers by considering the SOLID principle.

Designed a Rich domain model.

Used an in-memory database so don't need any RDBMS or NoSql on the machine. But if you want to use the 
SQL Server database then you can modify the **DependencyInjection.cs** file into the Infrastructure layer.

## Testing

Created an **IntegrationTest** project under the tests solution folder to test the RESTful product api.
	
Created a **UnitTest** project to test the different tariffs that calculates the annual cost.
